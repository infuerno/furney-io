## Previous long winded method

Previously, having located a birth, marriage or death in one of the GRO indexes, I used to download the photocopy of the typewritten index, file this to the "Genealogy" folder (independent folders organised by surname, place etc - see: [Setup Folders on Your Computer](https://genealogytools.com/toolbox/)). I then used to painstakingly transcribe the title of the page as well as the exact entry details - making sure to get all capitalization and abbreviations exactly so. I generally used one source for each of Births, Marriages and Deaths, but split Births into the two differently dated sets that most online sites use. The actual media and transcription details would then be within the citation record attached to that source.

## Revised method

* Single source for each index
  * GRO Birth Index
  * GRO Marriage Index
  * GRO Death Index
* Citation as previously for each entry, but no longer includes a scan of the index (might change my mind on this)
* Citation "where within source" follows a standard format: `Q1 1880 Camberwell 3a 181`
* Transcription:
  * Birth (including mother's maiden name) `Q1 1880 | Furney, Wilberforce James | McFifer | Camberwell | 3a | 181`
  * Marriage:
  * Death (including age or date of birth): `Q3 1970 | Furney, Wilberforce J | 90 | Shetlands | 55b | 100`
