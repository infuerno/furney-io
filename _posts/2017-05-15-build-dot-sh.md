Some preliminary set up required. What to do first? I wanted the barebones of a site online so I could record my thoughts and progress while I went along. I created a new folder, set up bower and git. And then before I knew it, was deep into how to configure either grunt or gulp to manage the production build of the assets. Neither of which I had much experience of. Sidetrack alert!! I shook myself, summoned some YAGNI, and wrote a simple build.sh to accomplish what I wanted immediately, publishing the initial version of the site via surge.sh
