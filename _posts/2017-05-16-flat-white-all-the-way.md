I’m cobbling my initial thoughts together on the tube into and out of work each day. Listened to a podcast featuring someone working at the National Archives whilst walking to the station. I’ve read little about one-name studies so far. According to wikipedia they usually involve comparitively rare surnames used by under a couple of thousand contemporary people. This due in part to the amateur nature of most studies of this type. People tend to have some technical skills to enable writing tools and scripts to scrape content from sites and update easily periodically for changes. So far so good. Another thought is that people have a tendency to use spreadsheets to see the data and using ‘thinking power’ to see patterns.

I’m currently writing all this in plain old html and already thinking I need to use markdown for these log type notes.
