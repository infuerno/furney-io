title: "Second beginnings"

I originally started this project in May 2017 after an initial "new year" flurry on building out the family tree further, hitting a bit of a wall and digressing into what I now know to be called a one name study. Back in May I set up a basic site, took some brief notes of progress, wrote some initial site scraping scripts and then got completely bogged down in the schema I would use to store the data.

Six months later, having reinstalled my laptop and lost most of the initial notes, I'm starting afresh.

I spent a while stripping the guts out of a [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com) project that time and pulling it every which way, but for now I'm falling back to a default implementation of a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) project and trying not to get distracted. I'm publishing up to [surge.sh](http://surge.sh) with the [domain I bought back in May](http://surge.sh/help/adding-a-custom-domain).
