## Census of England and Wales, 1841

* **Published by**: The National Archives, Kew, Surrey
* **Reference**: https://www.ancestry.co.uk/search/collections/8978/
* **Class number**: HO 107 
* **Date**: night of 6 June 1841

### Process

Enumeration forms were distributed to households, filled in and returned to the enumerator after census night. If illiterate the enumerator would help complete. Details from the original forms were copied into the enumerator's book (the pages we see today). Original forms were destroyed.

### Organisation

* Organised by county, hundred and parish
* Consecutive **piece** numbers were assigned to hundreds (or parts of hundreds). This is the number on the paper strip on the side or bottom of every page
* For 1841 census only, **pieces** were further divided into **books**
  * County > Hundred >= Piece > Book > Enumeration District
  * The **book** number rather than the enumeration district is the more important reference number. It is also shown on the strip of paper on each page after the piece number.
* Additionally each page also includes a **folio** and **page** number. The folio number is on every other page (upper right corner) and refers to this page and the following page (NOT the double spread), usually starting again at the beginning of each book. Page numbers are on every page (top centre) and start again at the beginning of each Enueration District
* A full reference number for a record in the 1841 census includes the PRO class number (HO 107), the piece number, the book number, and the folio number.

Gloucestershire > St Briavells > Newland. Since the place and the name of the head of household is also useful / interesting to see in indexes a full citation could also include this:

>HO107 365 3 42 21 ED20. Newland, St Briavells, Gloucestershire. FURNEY, Eliza Ann


Gloucestershire contained 27 to 39 hundreds of which [St Briavels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Briavels_Hundred) was one. In turn the St Briavels hundred contained 11 to 12 ancient parishes including [Newland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newland,_Gloucestershire) situated on the far west of Gloucestershire bordering Monmouthshire.
