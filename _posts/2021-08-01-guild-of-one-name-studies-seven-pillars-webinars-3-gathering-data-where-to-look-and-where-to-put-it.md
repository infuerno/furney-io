title: "Guild of One-Name Studies Seven Pillars Webinars: 3 Gathering Data:Where to Look and Where to Put it"
---

One-Name studies includes seeking, locating, aquiring, organizing, cataloging, displaying, storing and maintaining records pertinent to the individual study.

* Collecting records only - akin to a train spotter
* Collecting, creating family lines, putting people in the context of a period in history - may be preferable

Pre internet large studies were hard to progress so earlier studies are much smaller. Nowadays easy to collect vast volumes of data in hours.

## Sources for Data Collection

### Where to collect data
* Ancestry; FindMyPast; FamilySearch; My Heritage; Regional Archives; State and National Archives; International Datasets; Misc organisations
* Some sites enable exporting of data in CSV format

### What are the aims

* All studies are individual 
* Important to find your aims for data gathering and what you are hoping to achieve
* Collect data? Reconstruct families? Both? Neither right or wrong, just different

### Methods of Data Gathering

Popular to save data in a database which can be manipulated to show timeline of events for a person from birth to death and relationships to other people who are part of his life

* Big Three: Legacy, Family Historian, RootsMagic
* Also: FTM, Master Genealogist, Heredis, Reunion etc
* Other options: Excel, Evernote, Access, Custodian

### Approach to data collection

Start with a set of core records, build using other records they find. e.g. start in England and Wales and find all BMD for that surname.

### Transfer to database

* Type or transcribe, cut and paste, clip web page
* Outwit Hub
* Always keep a backup e.g. dropbox, carbonite

## Software 
### Master Genealogies
* Person and Events in their lives
* Type, Date, Name/Place
* Can highlight any event in a different colour
* Allocate roles to events 
* Chapman codes for counties e.g. DEV

### Source citations for Censuses
* Source is e.g. 1871 Census England & Wales - numbers sources logically e.g. 1 is Births, 2 Marriages, 3 Deaths, 1871 Census in 1871
* Citation gives
  * RG number: RG10 piece 2194, folio 55, page 15
  * Registration district: Torrington
  * Sub district: High Bickington
  * Enumeration district: 5B Civil Parish: Roborough
  * Address xxx
  * Transcript of people on census

### Source citations for Baptisms, Marriages, Deaths
* Source for each Baptism register, Marriage register and Death and Burial register e.g. Baptism Register Parish of Toynton All Saints, LIN
* Citation records the deatils
* Treat sources with images and those with transcriptions differently

## Paul Howe

* Can spend too much time on gathering data and not enough on family reconstruction
* Deal with small datasets NOW e.g. Victoria Cross dataaset
* Grab FREE stuff

### Sources

* Gale - download 2000 obituatries - try to identify these in own time
* FindAGrave
* National Archives - download for free 1500 service records and wills
* British County Record Offices
* Newspaper archives - e.g. Times - 200 years of fully searchable archives, Brooklyn Eagle - fantastic source from all round the world

### Methods

* Outwit Hub
* Family Historian - used to use FTM, but too restrictive - try to reconstruct families
* Spreadsheets - checklists only

### Main Goal

* Gather lists of data
* Reconstruct families from each piece of data and mark when done (how do you know when you've finished?)
* Work directly from commercial data e.g. census, bmd
* Enter every detail - 4 lines per person - name, date and place of birth, occupation, date and place of residence
* Sometimes can already enter straight into database e.g. have full marriage details including full names of parents of both parties
