## F for Foxtrot

![Furney, R.E.D. BT Telephone Directory entry 1977](/assets/images/furney-red-1977-bt-telephone-directory-snippet.png)

I grew up in the late seventies in St Mary's Platt, a small village in Kent which fell under the Tunbridge Wells Area of the BT telephone directory. I was always curious to see we were the only Furney in the book. "Furney", I'd hear my mother explain on the phone, "F for Foxtrot, u, r, n, e, y - we're the only one in the book". One day staying at a friend's house, I happened upon their neighbouring Maidsone Area directory (how exotic) and tentatively checked the Fs. No Furneys! Years later at college in Bristol, having moved into lodgings, I checked the BT directory in the house there - surely some Furneys in Bristol? But again none.

After college I had a job working a night shift for the Royal Bank of Scotland processing a tidal wave of new Tesco Bank savings account applications. As part of the application process we had to check the applicants in the electoral register or the phone book to validate identity. (This was pre the internet going mainstream as well as the majority of people getting fed up with cold calls and going ex-directory). We had access to a U.K. wide BT database. How many Furneys would I find here? I did a surreptitious search one night. Fifteen... - only fifteen! Even allowing for some people to be ex-directory, only a handful of families in the whole of the UK.

## Dawson

I'm proud of my more unusual surname, it makes up for having a tragically common first name. But when I first came across the Free BMD database online, it was my second middle name, Dawson, I was interested in finding more about. My full name is Claire Louise Dawson Furney. Myself, my sister, my father and his sister were all named Dawson Furney. This second middle name continues up the generations on my father's side and I was curious to know where it had come from and how far back it went. I traced it back through my father, my grandfather (Lewis George Dawson Furney), my great-grandfather (George Dawson Furney) and then to my great-great-grandfather. His name was Philip Henry Furney. Gone already. Slightly disappointed to find it had stopped so soon. His wife's maiden name wasn't Dawson and there were no other references to Dawson in any other ancestors. I wasn't sure where the name had come from, but at least I now knew when it had appeared.

Philip Henry Furney seemed to have led one of the more interesting lives amongst my ancestors. He was born in Glasgow, moved all over the country, married three times, had twelve children, spent some time in America as well as some time in one of the workhouses of London. His job is variously recorded in censuses as soap buyer or travelling salesman. Feeling flush I duly sent off for the marriage certificate for his second marriage to Lizzie Swaine, George Dawson's mother. 

I wasn't sure what I was expecting, certainly not to see the word Dawson on the marriage certificate - but there it was..!

> Married in the Church of the Saviour according to the Rites and Ceremonies of the United Christians by Licence by me, George Dawson, Minister, Alfred Cooper, Registrar

George Dawson was the minister who had conducted the marriage ceremony! And for some reason Philip Henry had decided to name one of his son's after him (and he, his son etc)! I googled George Dawson and it seemed he was a bit of a local celebrity of the time.

## On to Furney

Having quashed the amuse bouche, I refocused my efforts to trace Furney back further.
