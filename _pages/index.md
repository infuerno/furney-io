This project was started in May 2017 with sporadic attention. The information on this page will be refined as research progresses. See the [project roadmap](/roadmap/) for current intentions. The [study log](/slog/) pages have further informal notes, ideas, waffles and toast.

## What is a one-name study?

A one-name study generally has the following aims (from the [Guild of One-Name Studies](http://one-name.org) site):

* Research and collect all occurences of a surname
* Map the geographical distribution of the name and changes in the distribution over the centuries
* Reconstruct the genealogy of as many lines as possible
* Identity a single original location of the name

## How rare is Furney?

According to [Surnames of England and Wales – the ONS list](http://www.taliesin-arlein.net/names/) there were only 54 people in the UK with the surname Furney in 2002. The dataset size was approx 55.9 million, so less than 1 in a million.

On the other side of the pond, using the equivalent [U.S. Census Bureau genealogy](https://www.census.gov/topics/population/genealogy/data/2000_surnames.html) dataset from 2000, there were 826 people named Furney. The population size in the US in 2000 was approx 282.2 million, making this about 3 in every million people. (Interestingly the [more recent data set from 2010](https://www.census.gov/topics/population/genealogy/data/2010_surnames.html) has only 728 Furneys. Englebert retains 819 in comparison!)

The other columns shown in the spreadsheet confirm the population density of 0.31 Furneys in every 100,000 people and that, race wise, over 94% are white.

## Origins

I have no idea yet of the origins of Furney, but googling brings up a variety of conflicting theories.
