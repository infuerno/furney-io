    <h2>F for Foxtrot</h2>
    <p>â€‹I grew up in the late seventies and early eighties in St Mary's Platt, a small village in Kent which fell under the Tunbridge Wells Area of the BT telephone directory. I was always curious to see we were the only Furney in the book - "Furney" I'd hear my mum explain - "F for Foxtrot, u, r, n, e, y - there's only one in the book". One day whilst staying at a friend's house, I happened upon their neighbouring edition (how exotic) and tentatively checked the Fs. No Furneys. I went to college in Bristol - a much bigger city - surely some Furneys here? Again none.</p>
    <p>Some time after college I had a job working a night shift for the Royal Bank of Scotland processing Tesco's Bank applications. As part of the application process we had to check the applicants in the electoral register or the phone book and had access to search a U.K. wide database. How many Furneys? 15. Only 15 in the whole of the UK!</p>
